RIDGE REGRESSION AND ACTIVE LEARNING using only NumPy

For running the Code, you can explore the UCI Machine Learning Inventory. The UCI Machine Learning Repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/) has a good selection of datasets for regression.

For Ridge Regression:
Input : csvs containing training data and labels, penalising factor (lambda) and sigma sent as parameters. 
Output : csv that contains all the weight used for learning.
